to run the code on ubuntu one must activate the virtual environment form the project folder with the terminal prompt in the project folder:
# source venv/bin/activate

then we can direcctly install the needed librareis in the virtual environment we just created:
# pip install <my_library>


if still getting problems in running the gapwatch.py, try: 
# python3 -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# python -m pip install --upgrade pip
# pip install <my_library>
